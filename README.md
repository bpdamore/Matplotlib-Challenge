# Matplotlib-Challenge

## Pymaceuticals

In this challenge, I was tasked with analyzing the effectiveness of multiple hypothetical drug regimens. 

I was tasked with creating the following:

- Summary Statistics Table
- Bar Plot of the number of trials per drug regimen
    - There were to be two bar plots, one made with Pandas, one with Matplotlib
- Pie Chart of the Genders of mice being tested
    - There were to be two pie charts, one made with Pandas, one with Matplotlib
- Line Plot of the Tumor Volume through Time for a specific drug regimen
- Scatter Plot of the Mouse Weight and the Tumor Volume for a specific drug regimen
    - The correlation coefficient and a linear regression model should be made as well


## What Did I Find Out?


1. I found that the dataset is a very unbiased one when it comes to gender. It was made up of 50.6% male mice and 49.4% female mice. 

2. On average, the Capomulin drug regimen was very effective. The correlation between the time and tumor volume was a perfect negative slope. 

3. With the Capomulin drug regimen, the weight of the mouse and the tumor volume were almost perfectly correlated. As the weight went down, so did the tumor volume.
